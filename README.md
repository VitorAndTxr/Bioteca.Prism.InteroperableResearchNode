#Interoperable Research Node (IRN)
The Interoperable Research Node (IRN) is the core component of the PRISM (Project Research Interoperability and Standardization Model) framework. It is designed to break down data silos in biomedical research by creating a federated network of standardized, discoverable, and accessible research data.

##About The Project
Biomedical research, especially involving biosignals, often suffers from data fragmentation. Each research project tends to create its own isolated data ecosystem, making large-scale, collaborative studies difficult and inefficient.

The PRISM model proposes a new way to organize research projects by abstracting them into two fundamental elements: the Device (specialized hardware/software for biosignal capture) and the Application (general-purpose systems for adding context, processing, and storage).

The Interoperable Research Node (IRN) is the cornerstone of this model. It acts as a trusted, standardized gateway that manages data ingestion, authentication, storage, validation, and access. By requiring participating projects to adhere to its standardized interface, each IRN instance can communicate and share data with other nodes, creating a powerful, distributed network for scientific collaboration.

###Key Features
- Standardized Data Ingestion: Enforces a common data structure for all incoming biosignal records and metadata.

- Federated Identity & Access Management: Manages authentication and authorization for users and systems across the network.

- Data Validation Engine: Ensures that all stored data conforms to the PRISM standards, guaranteeing quality and consistency.

- Secure & Auditable Storage: Provides a secure repository for sensitive research data with clear access logs.

- Inter-Node Communication API: Allows different IRN instances to securely query and exchange data, enabling cross-project studies.

##Conceptual Architecture
The IRN facilitates the flow of information between the core components of a research project and the wider research network.
